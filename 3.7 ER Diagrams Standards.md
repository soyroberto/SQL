Figure 3.2 displays the COMPANY **ER database schema** as an **ER diagram**. We now review the full ER diagram notation. 

Regular (strong) entity types such as EMPLOYEE, DEPARTMENT, and PROJECT are shown in rectangular boxes. Relation-ship types such as WORKS_FOR, MANAGES, CONTROLS, and WORKS_ON are shown in diamond-shaped boxes attached to the participating entity types with straight lines. Attributes are shown in ovals, and each attribute is attached by a straight line to its entity type or relationship type. 

Component attributes of a composite attri-bute are attached to the oval representing the composite attribute, as illustrated by the Name attribute of EMPLOYEE. 

Multivalued attributes are shown in double ovals, as illustrated by the Locations attribute of DEPARTMENT. Key attributes have their names underlined. Derived attributes are shown in dotted ovals, as illustrated by the Number_of_employees attribute of DEPARTMENT.
