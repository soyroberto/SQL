You are required to develop an EER model for the problem description provided. The EER should contain all necessary information such as entities, attributes, primary keys, relationships (including specialisation/generalisation if any), cardinalities and participation (including (min, max)). All specialisations/generalisations and union types must be represented accordingly, instead of being treated as simple association relationships. Any assumptions should also be stated clearly. If assumptions are made, it is important to make sure that the assumptions reflect possible real practice for a particular industry and do not contradict the problem description above.Â **The assessment should be typed, not written/drawn by hand. Use any software to draw figures in your assessment (such as draw.io). You are required to use the EER notations introduced in the subject. No alternative notations are accepted in this assignment.**
