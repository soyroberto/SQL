**So, put simply, a domain is the set of values from which a simple row of a column takes its value**. #tldr 

**Domain refers to the scope of data values in a particular column of a table, that is, the values that a single row in that column can take.**
In an RDBMS, which is based on the relational data model, the concept of a **domain** is fundamental to defining the possible values that attributes (columns) can hold.

For example, we say:

- **The domain of the column ‘day’ in the ‘Shift’ table is the set of all possible days: {Mon, Tue, Wed, Thu, Fri, Sat, Sun} (Figure 1.5).**

Here's what the sources highlight about domains:

- In the formal relational model terminology, the **data type describing the types of values that can appear in each column is represented by a domain of possible values**.
- More formally, a **domain D is defined as a set of atomic values**. "Atomic" means that each value in the domain is indivisible from the perspective of the formal relational model.
- A common way to specify a domain is by specifying a **data type** from which the values are drawn. It's also useful to give the domain a name to help interpret its values.
- Domains can have **logical definitions** (e.g., "The set of ten-digit phone numbers valid in the United States"). They also have a data type or format associated with them (e.g., a character string format). Additional information like units of measurement for numeric domains can also be included.
- Examples of domains include `Usa_phone_numbers` (set of valid US phone numbers), `Employee_ages` (integer values between 15 and 80), `Academic_department_names` (set of specific department names), or `Academic_department_codes` (set of specific department codes).
- When defining a relation (table) schema R(A1, A2, ..., An), each attribute Ai is the name of a **role played by some domain D**, and D is called the domain of Ai.
- Multiple attributes can draw values from the **same domain**, but the attribute names indicate different roles or interpretations for that domain. For example, in an EMPLOYEE relation, `Home_phone` and `Office_phone` might both draw from the `USA_phone_numbers` domain but represent different types of phone numbers for the employee.
- Relation states (the actual data in the table at a given time) are sets of tuples, where each value in a tuple for attribute Ai must be an element of its defined domain dom(Ai) or a special NULL value. This concept is formally expressed as a relation state being a subset of the Cartesian product of the domains that define the relation schema.
- Domains are crucial for defining **Domain Constraints**, which are a type of integrity constraint. Domain constraints specify that the value of each attribute must be an atomic value from its corresponding domain. If a value is not of the correct type or format, it should be rejected to maintain data integrity.
- In SQL, the practical language for RDBMSs, you typically specify the **data type** for each attribute directly when creating a table. However, SQL also allows you to **declare a domain** using the `CREATE DOMAIN` statement and then use the domain name with attribute specifications. This approach makes it easier to manage data types across multiple attributes and improves schema readability. You can even specify constraints, such as `CHECK` clauses, as part of a domain definition.
- Domains are also related to the value sets used in conceptual modeling, such as the Entity-Relationship (ER) model, which specify the set of values for an attribute.
- In formal relational calculus, particularly domain relational calculus, variables range over single values from the domains of attributes.

In essence, a domain in an RDBMS formally defines the pool of acceptable, atomic values for one or more attributes, playing a key role in both the structure and the integrity of the database.
