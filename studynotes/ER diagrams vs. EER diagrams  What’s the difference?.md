## What is an ER diagram?

An entity-relationship diagram (ER diagram), also called an entity-relationship model, is aptly named because it shows the relationships between entities within an ER model. ER diagrams are most commonly used to organize data within databases or information systems. Their purpose is to visually represent the structure and logic of databases, making it easier to understand and manage complex data relationships.

### ER diagram symbols

A conceptual ER diagram uses six standard symbols.

1. **Entities** are objects or concepts that represent important data. Also known as strong entities or parent entities, these entities will often have weak entities that depend on them.
2. **Attributes** are characteristics of an entity (i.e., many-to-many or one-to-one). The primary key is crucial in establishing unique identification and relational schema.
3. **Relationships** are associations between entities.
4. **Weak entities** depend on another entity.
5. **Multivalued attributes** are attributes that can have more than one value.
6. **Weak relationships** are the connections between a weak entity and its parent.
